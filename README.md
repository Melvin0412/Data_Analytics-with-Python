Comparing the rating of movies across several other online websites against that of Fandango's and to identify if there were variations  using Python

## Overview
In 2015 there were reports that the movie ratings website Fandango was manipulating its ratings.The investigation noted that the site's method for calculating ratings made it rare for a movie to ever receive an overall rating below three stars
The goal compare the rating of movies across several other online websites against that of Fandango's and to identify if there were variations. I will be using Pandas,Matplotlib and Seaborn to perform this analysis
